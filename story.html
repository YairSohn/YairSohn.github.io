    <h1>Do You Want to Land a Corporate Instructional Design Job? </h1>
    <p> Although I cannot promise you the secret forumla to land the job of your dreams,
         I may be able to provide some insight by telling you my story. </p>

         <h2>But first, let's talk about how I failed miserbaly...</h2>

         <p> When I first started college, I thought I wanted to be an accountant.
             Mostly because I didn't actually know what I wanted to be. 
             As far as I was concerned, all I needed was a stable job and a decent salary. 
             So I started taking accounting classes at <em>Kean University</em> to get my Bachelor's in accounting, 
             and maybe go on to be a CPA.</p>
            <p>
                  In my second year, I decided to start an internship to begin building my resume.
              The intership was a forensic bookkeepping position (not technically accounting). 
              And I <strong>  STRUGGLED </strong> 
              to say the least. 
              Despite the fact that I was struggling to provide value as an 
              <em> unpaid intern</em>, I continued pursuing an accounting degree for another year.

              <h2>Then I reached a breaking point...</h2>
              </p>On top of going through an entire summer of feeling worthless, 
              I continued to lose hope in the advanced accounting classes. 
              Every day felt like I was missing some crucial foundational details for a given problem.
               I knew that if I didn't 
              change my career path, I would either end up failing too late, or living with imposter syndrome.
              <dfn>Imposter Syndrome</dfn> s when a person feels like a fraud due to a 
              dicrepancy betweem their status/position/authority and their actualy capabilities.

              <h2> So I quit</h2>
              <p>I didn't know at the time what I would pursue instead, but I knew I had to stop accounting.
                 I switched my major to Business Management, which 
                is just a fancy way of saying "I know some business stuff, but I don't have any 
                hard skills". Either way, I was in my third year, so I had to figure 
                out my gameplan <strong>fast.</strong>
              </p>

                <h2>So I talked to my sister</h2>
                <p>
                My sister is a very insightful person. I was talking to her about what interests me.
                 At this point in my life, I started using language learning apps in my free time. 
                In addition to seeing my own tangible self-improvement, I started to see how technology could change education.
                 My sister then told me about educational technology and instructional design. Knowing that I wanted to work corporate, I was immediately interested in Instructional Design.
                </p>
                <h2> Fast forward 6 months, I earned my degree</h2>
                  <p>Take a wild guess as to whether or not I was able to land an instructional design job immediately after college. Obviously, I had no credentials, 
                    and instructional design is more complex than people give it credit for. So I had no choice but to settle for unpaid 
                    internships <strong>AFTER GRADUATING COLLEGE</strong>! The first internship did not provide me with any eLearning development experience (which is a must if you want to work corporate), 
                    but it did provide curriculum developement experience which boosted my resume. </p>
                  
                    <h2>Once I completed my first internship, I immediately started a second with a startup called <em>Morphbots</em></h2>
                    <p>Morphbots is a company that creates eLearning for Arduino coding and circuitry. I got a lot of practice using Adobe Captivate, 
                      and it also gave me the opportunity demonstrate sample projects. As my tenure at Morphbots was coming to and end, I knew that I needed to create a portfolio.
                    To be honest, seeing entry level jobs requiring 3-5 years of experience was very scary. I wasn't sure if I would need to keep on doing more internships.
                    I certainly was sick of working for free.
                  </p>
                  <h2> So I applied to over 70+ jobs</h2>
                  <p>
                  Even though I didn't have an official portfolio, I knew that at least having a sample eLearning project had to count for something. 
                  lo and behold, I landed two interviews through connections, and another two through Linkedin alone.
                   I knew that if I wanted any chance at getting the job, I would have to bring my <strong>A Game</strong> to the interview. The first company told me that I didn't have enough experience (which did surprise me). 
                   But Medidata Solutions decided to give me a chance, and here I am. Now I'm confident that I'm providing value to my company, and I'm even making good impressions by finding new ways to 
                   innovate within our department. I helped contribute to the company's newly created guidelines for using generative AI, 
                   and on top of all that, I started a chess club with over 70 members. Next year, we plan on competing with other companies in the 
                   <abbr title="North American Corporate Chess League">NACCL</abbr>. </p>

                   <h1>My Final Advice</h1>
                   If you want to land a corporate ID job, make sure to do the following:
                   <ul>Keep working towards your Master's. I got lucky and didn't need it initally, but it definitely helps</ul>
                   <ul>Start ID internships as soon as possible</ul>
                   <ul>Ask the hiring managers if you will have the opportunity to gain experience with eLearning development tools such as Adobe Captivate or Articulate Storyline. <u>This is a must!</u></ul>
                   <ul>Build a portfolio with your projects</ul>
                   <ul>If you only have one project, use that when applying to jobs, even if you don't have a website yet</ul>
                   <ul><strong>Crush </strong>the interviews by learning as much as you can about the company beforehand. Everyone says they're willing to learn, but not everyone is willing to prove it.</ul>
