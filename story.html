    <h1>Do you want to work as a proffesional isntructional designer? </h1>
    <p> Although I cannot promise you the secret forumla to land the job of your dreams,
         I may be able to provide some insight by telling you my story. </p>

         <h2>But first, let's talk about how I failed miserbaly...</h2>

         <p> When I first started college, I thought I wanted to be an accountant.
             Mostly because I didn't actually know what I wanted to be. 
             As far as I was concerned, all I needed was a stable job and a decent salary. 
             So I started taking accounting classes at Kean University to get my bachelor's in accounting, 
             and maybe go on to be a CPA.</p>
            <p>
                  In my second year, I decided to start an internship to begin building my resume.
              The intership was technically in forensic bookkeepping (not accounting). 
              And I <strong>  Struggled </strong> 
              to say the least. 
              Despite the fact that I was struggling to provide value as an 
              <em> unpaid intern</em>, I continued puruing an accounting degree for another year.

              <h2>But then I reached a breaking point...</h2>
              </p>On top of going through an entire summer of feeling worthless, 
              I continued to lose hope in the advanced accounting classes. 
              Every day felt like I was missing some crucial/foundational details for a given problem.
               I knew that if I didn't 
              change my career path, I would either end up failing to late, or living with imposter syndrome.
              <dfn>Imposter Syndroms</dfn> Is when a person feels like a fraud due to a 
              dicrepancy betweem their status/position/authority and their actualy capabilities.

              <h2> So I quit.</h2>
              <p>I didn't know yet what I would pursue instead, but I knew I had to stop accounting.
                 I switched my major to Business Management, which 
                is just a fancy way of saying "I know some business stuff, but I don't have any 
                hard skills". Either way, I was in my third year, so I had to figure 
                out my gameplan <strong>fast</strong>fast </p>.
