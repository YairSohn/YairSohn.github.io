    <h1> Have You Ever Heard of SIBO? </h1>
      <p>SIBO Stands for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth. 
        It is a common GI disease that can cause people to 
        have severe GI symptoms and food sensitivities. 
       It is usually treated with antibiotics and diet.
       Patients who suffer from SIBO need to follow something called 
       the "Low <abbr title="fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols">FODMAP</abbr> Diet". 
       Foods that are high in FODMAPS contain high amounts of the
        carbohydrates which feed the bad gut bacteria.
