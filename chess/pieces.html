    <h2> Pawns</h2>

 <p>
    Pawns can move and attack in four different ways
 <ol> 1. Moving forward 1 square </ol>
 <ol> 2. Moving forward 2 squares (only when moving the pawn for the first time) </ol> 
 <ol> 3. Attacking another piece diagonally </ol>
 <ol> 4. En Passant (an advanced move that will be covered later) </ol>

 Note: Pawns Cannot move backwards. Also, if you manage to get a pawn to the other side of the board, it can be promoted to any piece (except for a king)
</p>

<h2>Knights</h2>
<p>
    <ol>Knights move in a L shape. They move two squares then one as follows</ol>
    <ol>Knights are the only pieces which can jump over other pieces</ol>
</p> 
    
<h2>Bishops</h2>
<p>
<ol>Bishops can only move diagnoally. 
    Therefore, a dark square bishop can only stay on dark squares, and a light squared bishop can only stay on light squares</ol>
<ol>bishops have unlimited range. </ol>    
</p>

<h2>Queens</h2>
<p>Queens can move in any direction with unlimited range.</p>

<h2>Rooks</h2>
<p>
    <ol>Rooks can only move in s straight line. 
    Therefore, a dark square bishop can only stay on dark squares, and a light squared bishop can only stay on light squares</ol>
<ol>bishops have unlimited range. </ol>
</p>

<h2>Kings</h2>
<ol>Kings can move 1 square in any direction</ol>
<ol>A king is not allowed to move itself into check (under attack). To do so would be an illegal move</ol>
