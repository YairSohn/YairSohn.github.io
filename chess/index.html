    <p> Chess may not be the oldest game in the world, but it is the most popular game that's ancient. 
        Chess has evolved over the years, but it's origins can be traced back over 1500 years. 
        It's truly amazing how a game which is 1500 years old has become even more trendy in the past few years.

        But why is that? There may be many answers, but the most likely answer is 
        that people respect the fact that it's a battle of the brains. The game demands strategy,
         preparation, wit, creativity, focus, etc. Chess is like Jui-Jitsu, but with your brain.
